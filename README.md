# SQL-sales-analysis-project
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data of a retail store using SQL. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw transactional data by writing structured SQL queries.
The analysis explores customer behavior, order patterns, and spending trends to simulate real-world business analysis tasks typically performed by data analysts.
This project was built to strengthen practical SQL skills and demonstrate the ability to work with relational databases.
# Objectives 
The main goals of this project are:

Analyze customer purchasing behavior

Identify high-spending customers

Understand order patterns and sequences

Perform revenue and spending analysis

Practice real-world SQL querying techniques
# Sql Concept Used
During this project, several important SQL concepts were applied:

Table Joins

Aggregations (SUM, COUNT)

CASE Statements

Subqueries

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Window Functions

Ranking Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)

These techniques help transform raw data into meaningful analytical insights.
# Project Structure
The project contains:

Database schema defining the tables used in the analysis

SQL queries answering different business questions related to sales and customers

The queries are organized step-by-step to demonstrate different SQL techniques used in data analysis.
# Analysis Performed
The project includes analysis such as:

Total orders per customer

Customer spending calculations

Customer order sequence analysis

Ranking customers based on spending

Product price comparisons using subqueries

Identifying high-value customers

These analyses mimic the types of questions businesses ask when evaluating sales performance.
# Tools Used
MySQL

MySQL Workbench

GitHub
# Learning Outcome

Through this project I improved my understanding of:

Writing complex SQL queries

Working with multiple relational tables

Using analytical SQL functions

Structuring a data analysis project.
# Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements include:

Adding more advanced SQL analysis

Creating dashboards using Power BI or Tableau

Performing deeper sales trend analysis.
